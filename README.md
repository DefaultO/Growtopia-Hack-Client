# Growtopia-Hack-Client
Basically a stolen [Minecraft Hack Client Design](https://sigmaclient.info/) ported to an Overlay for a 2D Version Minecraft-like Game. That Overlay comes with Memory Reading & Writing capabilities and is all based on the wonderful coding language C#. I have nothing in common with the devs of the original design. They worked it out, they should earn the credits for the clean design. By stealing their design I just agree that it is great thought out.

I won't release this yet. Stuff has to be done still. This repository's only purpose is to showcase this Overlay I've been working on since **Juli the first, 2020**.

## Preview
Looks worse than on my screen due to the compression algorithm of ScreenToGif.
