# Growtopia-Hack-Client
Basically a stolen [Minecraft Hack Client Design](https://sigmaclient.info/) ported to an Overlay for a 2D Version Minecraft-like Game. That Overlay comes with Memory Reading & Writing capabilities and is all based on the wonderful coding language C#. I have nothing in common with the devs of the original design. They worked it out, they should earn the credits for the clean design. By stealing their design I just agree that it is great thought out.

I won't release this yet. Stuff has to be done still. This repository's only purpose is to showcase this Overlay I've been working on since **Juli the first, 2020**. Another reason I won't release this yet is to avoid people pasting this menu for their ones in Growtopias Scene right now. Before there were actually trainers coded in an actual language, the creators used Cheat Engine Trainers to publish their cheats for this game. That all changed until someone actually released a working memory class 2-3 years ago, based on stuff you need for this game (opcode writing, etc). It came with a trainer design too which you will see getting copied over for every trainer out there with slight changes. This idea I am working on is not new for this scene, there were already Overlays, but I brought a Design you never have seen before here.

Looks worse than on my screen due to the compression algorithm of ScreenToGif.
